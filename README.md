ISE-Project-Group-21

This project contains codes and data for the ISE 3230 project group 21. 
The goal is to formulate an optimization problem in which, out of 42 possible venues for a Taylor Swift concert, 12 are chosen for her tour. 
The objective function is to maximize attendance (which is the sum of all capacities of the venues she visits). 
Taylor Swift cannot travel more than 500 miles at once between cities. She can only visit a city once.
ISE_Project_Group_21.ipynb contains the codes for the project in a notebook, along with the results of running the code with Gurobi.
Distances.txt contains the distances (in miles) between numerous source cities and destination cities, according to Google Maps.
Forty+ Of The Biggest Concert Venues.txt contains 42 cities home to the biggest concert venues still in use, and their capacities.
City Graph Edges - Sheet1.csv contains an organized list of the "edges" that Taylor Swift can travel on, with their source, destination, distance, capacity of destination, and edge number.
